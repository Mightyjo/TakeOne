# Take One
Author: Mightyjo

This add-on provides a context menu option to pull one item from a Bank or Guild Bank stack into your inventory.

# Requires 2 free slots in your backpack
When working with the Guild Bank it really just automates the process of withdrawing the whole stack in a bank slot, splitting out one item from the stack, and returning the remaining stack to the Guild Bank. Consequently, you must have 2 free slots in your backpack to withdraw 1 item from a Guild Bank stack. Annoying, but that's what the API allows.
