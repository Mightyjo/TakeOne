# Take One
Author: Mightyjo

Depends on: 
- LibAddonMenu-2.0 
- LibCustomMenu 
- LibMarify

Optionally depends on:
- LibDebugLogger
- DebugLogViewer

This add-on provides a context menu option to pull one item from a Bank or Guild Bank stack into your inventory.

The context menu item will only appear when all the preconditions to use it are met
- The source slot is in your Bank or Guild Bank.
- You have permission to withdraw and deposit into the Guild Bank.
- You have 2 free backpack slots (for Guild Bank withdrawals).
- The source stack contains more than 1 item.

# Requires 2 free slots in your backpack
When working with the Guild Bank it really just automates the process of withdrawing the whole stack in a bank slot, splitting out one item from the stack, and returning the remaining stack to the Guild Bank. Consequently, you must have 2 free slots in your backpack to withdraw 1 item from a Guild Bank stack. Annoying, but that's what the API allows.  

# Settings
You can turn on debug logging if you're having a problem. If you have DebugLogViewer installed you'll be able to see the add-on working in a UI window. Otherwise, the log is stored in your saved variables whenever you quit or /reloadui.
